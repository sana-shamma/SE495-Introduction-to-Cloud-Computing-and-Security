# Cloud Computing & Security ☁️🔐

## Project Summary 📝

This research provides a comprehensive review of cloud computing in the context of cybersecurity, with a focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The report is structured into four main sections:

1. **Literature Review on Cybersecurity in Cloud Computing** 📚
    - Summarizes key academic literature on the latest trends and best practices in cloud security.
    - Discusses core cybersecurity concepts within the AWS environment, including cryptography and the configuration of AWS security architecture for sustainable social networks.

2. **Analysis of AWS Security Services** 🛡️
    - Highlights and evaluates specific AWS security services such as Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
    - Discusses the pros and cons of these services and their potential use cases in real-world scenarios.

3. **Best Security Practices in The Cloud** 🌐🔒
    - Outlines essential security practices to be adopted in the cloud to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - Explores the 'three As' of security (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) and how AWS services like IAM, MFA, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch help achieve these principles.

4. **Conclusion** 🔍
    - Summarizes the findings and emphasizes the importance of aligning theoretical cybersecurity knowledge with practical applications in cloud-based systems.
